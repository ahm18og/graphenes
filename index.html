        <h2 id="gInfoH" class="topics">What are graphenes?</h2>
        <p id="g1Info" class="subs">Graphenes are materials that are extracted from graphites and 
                                    is made up of pure carbon. Graphines were founded in the year 
                                    2003 - 2004 by Andre Geim and Kostya Novoselov at the 
                                    University of Manchester. Graphenes are atom thick, meaning
                                    their thickness is the same thickness as a single atom.

        <p id="g2Info" class="subs">Graphenes are flexible and light while also being tough and 
                                    has high-resistance, and it conducts electricity very well too
                                    meaning it can make for better technologies like bendable and 
                                    lighter phones, and other devices with faster charging and 
                                    better performance.

        <p id="g3Info" class="subs">Graphenes are also great at handling heat, relating to how it's 
                                    also good at electricity conduction, meaning that this is also 
                                    important for electronic components that heats alot like 
                                    computers or batteries.

            I know that this information is probably going to be 
            useless since no one cares about this website more than 
            me (the person who created this website), but I'm 
            going to say it anyways because why not. The reason why 
            I used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS instead of something 
            like Wix or Google Sites is because I want to make the 
            interactable part of this website, actually interactable 
            and you can't make anything interactable in Google Sites 
            because it only lets you add buttons, labels, and other 
            texts, and I think it's very limited. Also, learning 
            JavaScript, HTML, and CSS not only taught me how to 
            make an actual interactable website, but it also taught 
            me that using templates/limited things are actually annoying.
